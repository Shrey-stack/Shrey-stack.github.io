                    <h1>AWS EC2</h1>

                </header>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ec2.png" alt="" /></div>
                <p>
                    An EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
                    for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.
                    You can think of it as AWS allowing users to rent virtual computers on which you can run your own
                    computer applications
                </p>

                <p>
                <h3>Let's get started:</h3><br />
                First things first, AWS offers free tier so everything I am doing, falls under the free tier.
                Create and activate your AWS account. You just need a card for it. I was charged $1.5 and was refunded
                later.
                Then go to EC2 under services and click on Launch services.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami1.png" alt="" /></div>
                I chose the Ubuntu server.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami2.png" alt="" /></div>
                Then choose t2 micro and next cause you don't want to pay for it right!
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami3.png" alt="" /></div>
                I made no changes. Just pressed next!
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami4.png" alt="" /></div>
                Press next!
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami5.png" alt="" /></div>
                <b>Step 5</b> - Add Tags is where you want to add tags.
                You can give any name you like. I gave ec2test because that was basically what I was doing.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami6.png" alt="" /></div>
                <b>Step 6</b> - Configure security group can always be ammended later but since I was going to host a
                webpage, I decided to add HTTP. <br />
                In the source section, I chose anywhere.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami7.png" alt="" /></div>
                Nth to do - Press Launch.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami8.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now this is the tricky part where you'll be asked whether you want a new security key or an existing
                one.
                I always go for new key everytime I launch a new instance and I make sure I give a unique name which is
                not similar to the previous keys or else you'll have an error.
                <b>And please don't forget to download your key pair... I repeat <h3>DO NOT FORGET IT!!!</h3></b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami9.png" alt="" /></div>
                Save file and Voilà, you have your new EC2 instance running!<br />
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami10.png" alt="" /></div>
                Ignore the top 2 terminated instances. I tried several times before I actually gained some confidence.
                Its quite confusing.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami11.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now you click the left button beside the Name and click connect.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami12.png" alt="" /></div>
                Click the third option, SSH client! This is how you can connect to your instance using SSH.
                You have all the details here that you want to use it in your terminal.
                Now, open your terminal.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami13.png" alt="" /></div>
                OH, HELLO BLACK SCREEN! Missed me??? <br />
                So now you want to go to the folder where you have your secret key saved.
                I have it in the downloads folder. And i also got my tech-challenge directory in the downloads because
                that is what I want to host on my EC2.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami14.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now you would want to change the permission of the downloaded key which in my case is the ec2test.pem
                file.
                We give a chmod 400 filename command which basiclaly gives the owner to just read it, can't write, can't
                execute.
                Group and others can't even read it! <br />
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami15.png" alt="" /></div>
                Go to the SSH client section on your EC2 instance and there, from the example section, copy the command
                and paste it on your terminal.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami16.png" alt="" /></div>
                And Voilà, you are now in your virtual server.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami17.png" alt="" /></div>
                First things first, if you're hosting a website, make sure to install apache.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami18.png" alt="" /></div>
                Then you would go to /var/www/html and ls and delete the index.html because you would want your website
                there and not apache's page right!
                But make sure you delete the index.html in the html folder and not html folder as a whole.
                I did it once and oh boy! It went pretty rough after that!
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami19.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now to securely copy the files, make sure you have SSH installed on your virtual server.
                Let me breakdown this command for you.
                <u>scp -r -i "ec2test.pem"
                    tech-challenge/ubuntu@ec2-35-183-50-234.ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu </u>
                <b> scp </b> : Secure Copy Protocol command.<br />
                <br> -r </br> : recursive since its a directory and not a file.<br />
                <b> -i </b> : Identity.<br />
                <b> ec2test.pem </b> : The secret keypair which we downloaded earlier.<br />
                <b> tech-challenge/ </b> : The directory which I am going to copy. This directory and the secret
                keypair.<br />
                need not be on the same place. You can give the path and then the name after the secret key. I just do
                this because I find it easier this way.<br />
                <b> ubuntu@ec2..... </b> : So this is basically how I connect to my instance. It's unique and as
                mentioned above, you can find this in the SSH client section from the AWS EC2 Instances section.<br />
                <b> :/home/ubuntu </b> : This is where I am giving a command as to where to copy the directory. Here I
                am commanding it t copy it on my home folder.<br />
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami20.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now I am copying the tech-challenge directory from my home to the html folder because that is where I
                want to host my webpage.
                <br />
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/ami21.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now you go to your EC2 Instance Connect and go to your public IP address and if you got it all right,
                <b>Voilà</b>
                you just hosted you website in a virtual server. A round of applause for yourself. <br />
                <div>
                    <video video width="320" height="240" controls>
                        <source src="images/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                    </video></div>

                So this is the webpage I hosted on my EC2 instance and you know why it's special - <b> coz I MADE
                    IT!!!</b>
                It was just for admission purpose using fully HTML and CSS and I am really looking forward to and yeah!
                that's pretty much it!!!

                <p>
                    Please give it a try and make sure you don't have a lot of instances or else AWS might charge you.
                    For best practice, make an instance do all the testing you want, delete it and then only make
                    another
                    instance.
                    MAke the best of the free tier and Good-luck!!!

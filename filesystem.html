									<h1>Linux File System</h1>

								<p>
                                    Linux file system has a hierarchal file structure as it contains a root directory and its subdirectories.
                                    The Linux directory structure is like a tree. The base of the Linux file system hierarchy begins at the root. Directories branch off the root, but everything starts at root.
                                    The directory separator in Linux is the forward slash (/). Often the root of the file system is referred to as “slash” since the full path to it is /. 
                                    If you hear someone say “look in slash” or “that file is in slash,” they are referring to the root directory.

                                    <h3>Let's take a look into the file system in brief</h3>
                                   <br />
									
                                    <b>/root</b><br />
                                    The root filesystem is the top-level directory of the filesystem. It must contain all of the files required to boot the Linux system before other filesystems are mounted. 
                                    It must include all of the required executables and libraries required to boot the remaining filesystems. After the system is booted, all other filesystems are mounted on standard, well-defined mount points as subdirectories of the root filesystem.
                                    <br/>

                                    The /bin directory contains user executable files.
                                    The core command of Linux such as mv, ls can be found here.<br />

                                    <br />

					I did my ACCA (Chartered Accountancy) right after my high school. 
					Regarding my professional life, I started as a banking intern and then moved my way upwards to 
					Audit Associate. There, I learnt a lot about financial aspects of a company. 
					After completing my studies, I went and worked as a Business Development Officer in a software company,
					which also happened to be Amazon Web Service's advance partner.
					I learnt about cloud computing and how it has changed the world as a whole. 
					This experience ignited the desire to work in a tech field and emerge myself into IT. 
             <br />
              And here I am showcasing my projects.

                Linux is an operating system just like Windows and Mac OS. But Linux also is different from other operating 
                systems in many important ways. 
                First, and perhaps most importantly, Linux is open source software. 
                The code used to create Linux is free and available to the public to view, edit, and—for users with the appropriate skills—to contribute to.
                here are many distributions of Linux, which include different software options. 
                This means that Linux is incredibly customizable.
                Linux users also can choose core components, such as which system displays graphics, and other user-interface components.

              Linux file system is generally a built-in layer of a Linux operating system used to handle the positioning of your data on the storage. 
              It helps to arrange the file on the disk storage. 
              It manages the file name, file size, creation date, and much more information about a file.
              Without it, the system cannot knows which file starts from where and ends where.

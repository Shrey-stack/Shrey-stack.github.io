                <p>
                    <b>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</b>
                    Amazon VPC lets us provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud
                    where we can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that we define. We can have complete control
                    over our virtual networking environment, including selection of our own IP address ranges, creation
                    of subnets and configuration of route tables and network gateways. <br /></p>
                <p>
                <h2>Components of Amazon VPC:</h2><br />
                * <b>Virtual Private Cloud:</b>A logically isolated virtual network in the AWS cloud. We define a VPC’s
                IP address space from ranges we can select. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the
                AWS Cloud. We can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into our VPC. We can
                configure our VPC by modifying its IP address range, create subnets, and configure route tables, network
                gateways and security settings. <br />
                * <b>Subnet:</b>A segment of a VPC’s IP address range where we can place groups of isolated
                resources.<br />
                * <b>Internet Gateway:</b>The Amazon VPC side of a connection to the public Internet.<br />
                * <b>NAT Gateway:</b>A highly available, managed Network Address Translation (NAT) service for our
                resources in a private subnet to access the Internet.<br />
                * <b>VPC and Subnet Sizing for IPv4:</b>When you create a VPC, you must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for
                the VPC. The allowed block size is between a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses) and /28 netmask (16 IP
                addresses). After you've created your VPC, you can associate secondary CIDR blocks with the VPC.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h2>Let's get started</h2>
                Go to services and in Networking and Content Delivery section, choose VPC
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc1.png" alt="" /></div>
                Then choose Create VPC, give it a name, I gave mine MyVPC and my IPv4 address as 10.0.0.0/16(it could be
                anywhere between 16-24).<br>
                We're not dealing with IPv6 for now so not assigning anything and for tenancy we choose default. And we
                <b>CREATE our first VPC</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc2.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now, you may have noticed that our VPC creates Route table,Security Group and NAT but there is no Subnet
                and Internet Gateway.<br />
                So we choose Subnet section from the left hand side column and we create it.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc3.png" alt="" /></div>
                So now we create two instances-one Public and one Private<br />
                <b>First instance:</b><br />
                * <b>Name:</b>MyPublicSubnet<br />
                * <b>VPC:</b>My VPC (the one we created earlier)<br />
                * <b>Availability zone:</b>1a <br />
                * <b>VPC CDR:</b>10.0.0.0/16<br />
                * <b>IPv4 CIDR Block:</b>10.0.1.0/24 <br />
                <b>CREATE</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc4.png" alt="" /></div>
                <b>Second instance:</b><br />
                * <b>Name:</b>MyPrivateSubnet<br />
                * <b>VPC:</b>My VPC (the one we created earlier)<br />
                * <b>Availability zone:</b>1b <br />
                * <b>VPC CDR:</b>10.0.0.0/16<br />
                * <b>IPv4 CIDR Block:</b>10.0.2.0/24 <br />
                <b>CREATE</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc5.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now we create our Internet Gateway.<br />
                Choose Internet Gateway section from the left hand side column and click on Internet Gateway.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc6.png" alt="" /></div>
                We name it MyIGW.<br />
                Then from the Actions menu from the upper right hand side, we click on Attach to VPC.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc7.png" alt="" /></div>
                We choose MyVPC and we attach our Internet Gateway to it.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc8.png" alt="" /></div>
                The next thing we do is create a route table and we name it <b>MyPublicRT.</b><br />
                In the VPC section we choose <b>MyVPC.</b><br />
                <b>CREATE</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc9.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now from the route table, we choose MyPublicRT, the one we created just now.
                From the section below the route table we choose <b>Routes</b> and click on <b>Edit Routes.</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc10.png" alt="" /></div>
                Then we <b>Add Route </b><br />
                <b>Destination:</b>0.0.0.0<br />
                <b>Target:</b>MyIGW<br />
                <b>Save Routes</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc11.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now we choose <b>Subnet Associations</b><br />
                <b>Edit Subnet Associations</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc12.png" alt="" /></div>
                We just choose <b>MyPublicSubnet</b>
                <b>Save</b>
                We do this because we just want to give Internet Gateway Access to MyPublicSubnet and not
                MyPrivateSubnet.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc13.png" alt="" /></div>
                Let's verify it. <br />
                We choose <b>MyPrivateSubnet</b> and then we select <b>Route Table</b><br />
                There we see that Internet Gateway is not associated with it.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc14.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now we choose <b>MyPublicSubnet</b> and then we select <b>Route Table</b><br />
                There we see that Internet Gateway is associated with it.
                Then from the <b>Actions</b> section we choose <b>Modify Auto Assign IP</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc15.png" alt="" /></div>
                We select the <b>Auto Assign IPv4</b><br />
                <b>SAVE</b><br />
                <b>Voilà</b> you're finally done with the VPC seetings.<br />
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc17.png" alt="" /></div>
                First things first, we're going to create two EC2- <b>MyPublicEc2</b> and <b>MyPrivate EC2</b><br />
                We start with <h3><b>MyPublicEC2</b></h3>
                Lets start with our first one.<br />
                Just like our normal process, we choose Ubuntu and the t2 instance type.<br />
                Then comes the <b>Configure Instance Details</b> where we make changes to our usual way. <br />
                In the <b>Network</b> section, we choose MYVPC, the one we created earlier. <br />
                In the <b>Subnet</b> section, we choose MyPublicSubnet, the one we created earlier.<br />
                <b>Add Storage</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc18.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now we shall make changes to the <b>Security Group.</b> <br />
                From the <b>Type</b> section, we add <b>All ICMP-IPv4</b> and in the <b>Source Section</b> we simply put
                it in default, i.e. 0.0.0.0
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc19.png" alt="" /></div>
                Similarly we add HTTP. <br />
                From the <b>Type</b> section, we add <b>HTTP</b> and in the <b>Source Section</b> we simply put
                0.0.0.0/0
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc20.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now, we repeat the same process for <h3><b>MyPrivate EC2</b></h3>
                In the <b>Configure Instance Details</b> we make changes as mentioned earlier. <br />
                In the <b>Network</b> section, we choose MYVPC, the one we created earlier. <br />
                In the <b>Subnet</b> section, we choose MyPrivateSubnet, the one we created earlier.<br />
                <b>Add Storage</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc21.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now we shall make changes to the <b>Security Group.</b> <br />
                From the <b>Type</b> section, we add <b>All ICMP-IPv4</b> and in the <b>Source Section</b> we simply put
                <b>10.0.1.0/24,</b> the IPv4 address of <b>MyPublicSubnet</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpccrop.png" alt="" /></div>
                We choose the same existing key we created for our first EC2 instance, i.e. <b>MyPublicEC2</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc22.png" alt="" /></div>
                Then, we go to our Search section and simply type <b>Putty</b><br />
                We use Putty because we are going to connect to our EC2 instance via Windows and not Ubuntu.<br />
                If you're using Ubuntu then you can ignore this process.
                I hope you all have downloaded Putty. I have shown how to download it in one of my earlier blog.<br />
                Please select <b>Puttygen</b> - the one with key.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc23.png" alt="" /></div>
                We click on the <b>Load Key</b> option and we select the key we downloaded earlier. <br />
                Please make sure you're searching in the exact location where you've kept your key. Mine is on the
                <b>Desktop</b> folder.<br />
                Make sure you select <b>All Files</b> from the section below.<br />
                Choose your key and select <b>OK </b> and then click on <b>Save Private Key.</b><br />
                We give it the same name and Save it.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc24.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now we go to Search and again type Putty. This time we select the <b>Desktop app,</b> the one without
                the key.<br />
                In the <b>Host Name</b> we write the IPv4 address of MyPublicEC2.<br />
                Then from the left hand column we chhose <b>SSH-Auth-GSSAPI</b> <br />
                Choose browse, go to all files and select the converted key, the one with the computer logo.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc25.png" alt="" /></div>
                You will see a <b>Security Alert</b> box, simply type OK
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc26.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now, a black window opens, somewhat like Command Prompt, that is just Putty and it asks <b>login
                    as</b><br />
                Simply type <b>ubuntu</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc27.png" alt="" /></div>
                <b>Voilà</b> you are now in your PublicEC2 instance.<br />
                Such a lengthy process, I know I know!!!<br />
                I pinged google.com just to see if it's working or not, and It is.... <b>WOHOO!!!</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc28.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now from your <b>MyPrivateEc2</b> you copy the Private IPv4 address. <br />
                (Note that the provate EC2 doesn't have public IP address assigned to it coz no internet gateway has
                been accessed to it.)
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc29.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now we ping to that IP address and It's working fine....But wait a minute....<b>HOW???</b><br />
                That is because we have given it the permission earlier in the security group, remember???
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc30.png" alt="" /></div>
                Let's delete that inbound rules, shall we? <br />
                Go to security group of MyPrivateEC2 and edit inbound rules and delete the All ICMP-IPv4.<br />
                <b>SAVE</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc31.png" alt="" /></div>
                What happens when we ping it now???<br />
                It doesn't respond right!
                So how ae we going to communicate with it or get in the server when it doesn't even have a public IP
                address?
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc32.png" alt="" /></div>
                We open our keypair the original one, the one that isn't converted in a text editor, I used
                <b>Notepad</b> <br />
                And we copy the contents in it.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc33.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now we go to our server and we simply type nano and give it the same name as our keyfile. <br />
                Mine is VPCEC2.<br />
                What I type is nano VPCEC2 and we paste our content to it. <b>Ctrl X, Yes</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc34.png" alt="" /></div>
                After that we change the permission of our file by simply typing: <br />
                chmod 0600 filename <br />
                In my case <u>chmod 0600 VPCEC2</u>
                Then we login to our private EC2 instance.
                Simply type <b>ssh ubuntu@(Private IP address of MyPrivateEC2) -i filename</b><br />
                In my case, <b>ssh ubuntu@10.0.2.174 -i VPCEC2</b><br />
                Fingerprint-yes
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc35.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now guess who is inside their PrivateEC2 intance??? <b>Wohoo!</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc36.png" alt="" /></div>
                Let's try to update it. <br />
                <b>sudo apt update</b><br />
                Doesn't work right! Thats coz no internet gateway has been assocaied to it.<br />
                But our main purpose was to get in the priavte server via public server through EC2 right which we did
                pretty well.

                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc37.png" alt="" /></div>
                So lets exit.<br />
                We're still in our PublicEC2 instance so let's exit again.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/vpc38.png" alt="" /></div>
                And <b>Voilà WE ARE DONE!</b><br />
                I know it's a lengthy process but please try it! It's so fun and exciting and you'll learn a lot in the
                process.<br />
                <b>GOODLUCK!</b>
                </p>

                    <h1>Setting up Wordpress on Amazon EC2</h1>

                </header>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/iwp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                <p>
                    WordPress is open-source software and most popular CMS (content management system) platform used by
                    many developers and entrepreneurs around the world to run their blogs and fully functioning
                    websites.

                    In addition, WordPress is a fully-managed customizable platform with thousands of themes and plugins
                    supported by a large global community. <br /></p>
                <p>
                    I assume that your EC2 Ubuntu server has been launched and you're already connected to the remote
                    server.<br />
                    The first thing you're going to do is install <b>apache</b> to your server.
                    If you manage your website hosting using the WordPress platform, you will need to required
                    installing a web server software.Hence Apche2 tada!

                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp1.png" alt="" /></div>
                The next step is to install database to store and retrieve every requested data. In this case, we are
                going to install <b>mariadb-server and mariadb-client</b> within the EC2 Ubuntu instance.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp2.png" alt="" /></div>
                Next, we are going to install <b>mysql_secure_installation.</b> <br />
                mysql_secure_installation is a shell script that enables you to improve the
                security of your MariaDB installation in the following ways:<br />

                * You can set a password for root accounts.<br />
                * You can remove root accounts that are accessible from outside the local host.<br />
                * You can remove anonymous-user accounts.<br />
                * You can remove the test database, which by default can be accessed by anonymous users.

                You will be asked to enter the current password for root, Simply press <br>ENTER</br><br />
                Then you will be asked to set root's password. Type y <br />
                Set a password and make sure you don't forget it. Re-enter your password. <br />

                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp3.png" alt="" /></div>
                After that you will be asked to remove anonymous users. Press <b>Y</b><br />
                Disallow root login. Press <b>Y</b><br />
                Remove test database and access to it. Press <b>Y</b><br />
                Reload privilege table. Press <b>Y</b><br />
                and <b>Voilà</b> you're done!(for sometime!)
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp4.png" alt="" /></div>
                The next step is to install PHP.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp6.png" alt="" /></div>
                After you're done installing the basics which is very similar to LAMP stack, you finally install
                wordpress.<br />
                Oh no! Wait a minute!<br />
                A small step to do before installing wordpress and i.e.,
                To install <b>wget and unzip </b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp7.png" alt="" /></div>
                And finally you go to your web browser and search Download Wordpress or simply press here.
                <a href="https://en-ca.wordpress.org/download/"><br />Download Wordpress</a>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp5.png" alt="" /></div>
                So in the blue <b>Download Wordpress 5.5.1,</b>you rightclick it and you copy the link.<br />
                Go to the terminal, type sudo wget and <b>paste the link.</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp8.png" alt="" /></div>
                After the download is complete, type ls.
                You will see the zip file there.
                Then simply type <b>sudo unzip latest+tab key</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp9.png" alt="" /></div>
                And ta-da your wordpress is installed!
                Then you copy the wordpress file to /var/www/html.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp10.png" alt="" /></div>

                First things first, you would want to remove your <b>index.html</b> coz you don't want the apache page
                to be shown when you open your browser.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp11.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now you've got to change the owner of the group.
                To check the owner, simply type <b>ls -l.</b><br />
                You can see that all the contents belongs to root.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp13.png" alt="" /></div>
                You would want to give wordpress the file permissions. <br />
                So simpley type the command below:<br />
                <b>sudo chown www-data:www-data -R /var/www/html/</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp14.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now the final thing you would do is to create database and user for it.<br />
                So you simply type the command <br />
                <b>sudo mysql -u root -p</b>
                You enter the password you used above while creating the secure installation. I told you to remember it.
                <br />
                Now you're logged in to your database.
                So the first thing to do here is to create database. Simple type<br />
                <b>create database wordpress;</b> (Wordpress is just a name I gave for my database.)<br />
                Then you create a user by <br />
                <b>create user"wpadmin"@"%" identified by "wpadminpass";</b> (Here, my username is wpadmin and password
                is wpadminpass)
                After that you grant privileges to your user by <br />
                <b>grant all privileges on wordpress.* to "wpadmin"@"%";</b><br />
                You're pretty much done! Type exit!
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp15.png" alt="" /></div>
                If you think you're finally done, go to EC2 instance and get your public address and view it.
                If it works <b>YAHOO!!1</b>but if it doesn't then no worries, just a simple thing to do!!!
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp17.png" alt="" /></div>
                Go to your EC2 security group, edit your inbound rules and simply add HTTP and HTTPS. In the source, you
                would simply press anywhere. <b>SAVE IT.</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp16.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now go to your browser type your public address and this is what you'll be seeing now. Simple press
                <b>Let's Go</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp18.png" alt="" /></div>
                Type your database name, databaseadmin and the password. <br />
                Make no changes to the Database Host and the Table Preflix.<br>
                Press <b>Submit</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp19.png" alt="" /></div>
                Press <b>Run the installation!</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp20.png" alt="" /></div>
                You will be asked for your Site-Title, Username, Password and Email. The username and passwords are not
                the one you used earlier for your database.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp21.png" alt="" /></div>
                Now, you'll be asked to login
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp22.png" alt="" /></div>
                You will now be directed to the Wordpress Dashboard.<br />
                If you see above the dashboard slightly towards the left side, you'll see a home icon. Click the icon
                and
                press the <b>Visit Site</b>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp24.png" alt="" /></div>
                And <b>Voilà! You're done!!!</b>
                Congratulations for setting wordpress on your EC2 instance. You completely deserve a pat on the back
                even if you have to do it Yourself!
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/wp25.png" alt="" /></div>
